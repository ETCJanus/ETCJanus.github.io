            <h2>Introduction: Defining the Tinkering Playground</h2>
            
            <p>
                During our first session, we started by surfacing our own real-world tinkering experiences through a quick post-it braindump. The goal was to identify moments where we learned through open-ended exploration rather than strict instruction.
            </p>

            <h3>1. The Braindump</h3>
            <p>I listed three recent experiences where I found myself deep in the tinkering mindset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken wire art:</strong> Bending physical materials into organic shapes.</li>
                <li><strong>Piano visualizer:</strong> Bridging audio inputs with generative visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Hospital @ Home toolkit:</strong> Iterating on physical product design for patients.</li>
            </ul>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Deep Dive: Chicken-Wire Art</h3>
            <p>
                Next, we had to pick one specific experience and deconstruct it using the course's framework: Goal, Seed, and Toolbox. I chose my chicken-wire art project because it perfectly represents bridging the physical and digital worlds.
            </p>
            
            <div class="glass-card" style="padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.95rem;">
                <p><strong><i class="fas fa-bullseye" style="color: #2dd4bf; margin-right: 8px;"></i> Goal:</strong> Use a completely different physical material to create art, combined with digital code.</p>
                <p><strong><i class="fas fa-seedling" style="color: #a78bfa; margin-right: 8px;"></i> Seed:</strong> My mom sent me a video of an amazing art installation someone else made, which sparked the initial inspiration.</p>
                <p><strong><i class="fas fa-toolbox" style="color: #fbbf24; margin-right: 8px;"></i> Toolbox:</strong> Python, a beamer (projector), wire cutters, and chicken wire.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This exercise helped me realize that a "tinkering playground" isn't just about the tools you have; it is about the initial spark (the seed) that pushes you to combine those tools in novel ways.

            <h2>Material Affordances & Physical Computing</h2>
            
            <p>
                In the second lecture, we shifted our focus to physical computing and how the inherent properties (affordances) of different materials dictate how we tinker with them.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Micro:bit Deconstruction</h3>
            <p>
                We sketched a Micro:bit to highlight the specific hardware features that make it such a powerful tool for rapid prototyping. Its exposed pins, built-in LED matrix, and accessible sensors lower the barrier to entry while allowing for complex logical outputs.
            </p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Toolkit Affordance Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                We evaluated three different maker kits—Totem Maker, Minecraft Maker, and LittleBits—scoring them across various design affordances. Here are my findings:

                            <td>Pretty self-explanatory, but some mistakes were easily made.</td>
                            <td>Made of metal, feeling precious/expensive. Not cheap, but offers abundant parts.</td>

                            <td>Low threshold to step in, but the ceiling isn't very advanced. Got boring quickly.</td>

                            <td>Required prior understanding of coding and technology to use effectively.</td>
                            <td>Could be linked to a Raspberry Pi, which is nice, but very limited beyond that.</td>
                            <td>A bit outdated, though the core idea of adapting Minecraft for learning is novel.</td>
                            <td>The worst part of the kit. Decently high threshold, and you feel played out after a day.</td>

                            <td>Materials are expensive and not easily swappable. Low score in this regard.</td>
                            <td>Helps if you understand music, but you can successfully use it without prior skills.</td>
                            <td>Potentially USB compatible, but unclear. Quite limited interoperability overall.</td>
                            <td>Using sound as a primary tinkering medium is highly novel.</td>
                            <td>Low threshold. We played outside the box, and the ceiling for sound production is quite high.</td>
