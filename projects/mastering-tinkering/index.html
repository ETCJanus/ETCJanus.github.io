            <h2>Portfolio Setup</h2>
            <p>
                The goal was to set up a simple and practical online portfolio for the course. I decided to use this assignment as an opportunity to build my whole professional portfolio rather than just a course page. I used HTML5 and GitHub Pages to create this entire website, so everything you see here beyond this specific course represents work that came out of this portfolio project. It let me showcase my web development skills while having a proper home for all my creative work.

            <h2>Tinkering Spaces (Photo Safari)</h2>
            <p>
                For this assignment I thought back to places where I used to tinker and that were meaningful to me. I was thinking less about physical tinkering and more about the spaces where I tinker mentally with ideas and problems. Each space represents a different mode of thinking and making, all of which have influenced how I approach design.

            <h2>Design a Building Block: Screw Shapes</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Design a block that can be used for tinkering and quick prototyping.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went through around ten different design concepts, trying out various ways to connect pieces. I experimented with flexible connections, rigid ones, permanent attachments, and temporary ones. I ended up combining ideas from my 9th and 10th sketches, and settled on a screw based design. I chose screws because they're really good for quick iteration. You can swap different shapes and sizes in and out really fast, but they're still strong enough to hold things together properly. Unlike permanent connections, you can quickly take them apart and rebuild, which is what makes them good for tinkering. I also used AI to generate some 3D renderings to visualize how the design would actually look and work.

            <h2>Design a building block - fabricate</h2>
            <p>
                To bring my "screw shapes" concept into the physical world, I created a lo-fi prototype. I started by cutting basic shapes (cubes and blocks) out of wood. I then drilled holes into specific faces and attached standard screws using a glue gun. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Tinkering Process:</strong> During assembly, I quickly realized that the spacing and depth of the screws were crucial for stability. I spent a good amount of time just playing around with different hole placements, testing how the pieces slotted together before committing to the final glue-up. This messy, hands-on iteration helped me discover the physical constraints of the material, something that looked perfect in my digital sketches didn't always friction-fit well in reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, to add an extra layer of "tinkerability," I finished the blocks with a coat of black chalk paint. This allows the user to draw, write, or erase labels on the blocks themselves, rapidly changing their meaning or function on the fly during a brainstorming session.

                What struck me most was that LittleBits was the best one for actually tinkering around with, especially if you don't have any prior knowledge or expertise. It just made you curious and want to figure out what was possible. The Minecraft kit, on the other hand, felt more like a marketing product than something designed for real hands-on exploration.
