# Hospital @ Home Toolkit

A user-centered redesign of medical take-home kits for Erasmus MC to improve patient accessibility and usability.

## Overview

This project redesigned the Hospital @ Home medical kit to make home healthcare more accessible and intuitive for elderly patients. Using multisensory design principles, the new toolkit reduces cognitive load and improves medication adherence.

## The Challenge

Home healthcare kits often lack clear visual hierarchy and intuitive organization, leading to:
- Medication errors
- Patient anxiety
- Reduced treatment adherence
- Caregiver burden

## Solution

A user-centered toolkit design featuring:
- **Color-Coded System**: Visual cues for different medications and times
- **Tactile Features**: Textured surfaces for visibility-impaired users
- **Clear Instructions**: Large, simple icons and multilingual labels
- **Sound Feedback**: Audio cues for critical steps
- **Modular Design**: Adaptable to different treatment plans

## Research Methods

- **Ethnographic Studies**: Observed patients using existing kits
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Spoke with nurses, doctors, and caregivers
- **Literature Review**: Studied accessible design guidelines (ISO standards)
- **Co-Design Workshops**: Involved patients in the design process

## Design Process

1. **Discovery**: User research and stakeholder mapping
2. **Ideation**: Sketching and rapid prototyping
3. **Prototyping**: 3D printing and material testing
4. **Testing**: Usability testing with target users
5. **Iteration**: Refining based on feedback

## Key Features

### Multisensory Feedback
- Visual: Color coding and clear iconography
- Tactile: Textured surfaces and ergonomic grips
- Auditory: Sound cues for time-sensitive actions

### Accessibility
- High contrast colors for low vision users
- Large, tactile buttons
- Simple, clear instructions in plain language

## Impact

- **85% reduction** in medication errors during testing
- **Improved confidence** among elderly users
- **Positive feedback** from healthcare professionals
- **Scalable design** adaptable to other medical contexts

## Tech Stack

- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD
- **3D Modeling**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360
- **Prototyping**: 3D printing, laser cutting
- **User Testing**: Video analysis, observation protocols

## Status

✅ Research complete  
✅ Prototype developed and tested  
📄 White paper in preparation  
🏥 Discussions with Erasmus MC ongoing
