# Favicon and Social Image Setup

Your portfolio now has meta tags configured for favicons and social sharing. You need to create these image files:

## Required Images:

### 1. Favicon Files (place in `/assets/images/`)
- `favicon-16x16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `favicon-32x32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels

**Quick way to create them:**
1. Design a simple logo/icon (your initials "EJ" would work great)
2. Use a free online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Upload your design and download all the generated sizes
4. Place them in the `assets/images/` folder

### 2. Open Graph Preview Image
- `og-image.jpg` - 1200x630 pixels (recommended)
- This is what shows when you share your site on social media
- Should include your name, title, and maybe a cool visual
- Place in `/assets/images/`

**Design tips:**
- Use your brand colors (purple/teal from your site)
- Include text: "Ewoud Janus | Interaction Technologist"
- Keep important content in the center (social platforms crop differently)
- Use Figma, Canva, or Photoshop

## Quick Test:

After adding the images:
1. Test favicons: Open your site and check the browser tab
2. Test social sharing: Use https://www.opengraph.xyz/ to preview how your site will look when shared

## Current Meta Tag Setup:

All pages now have:
- ✅ SEO meta descriptions
- ✅ Open Graph tags (Facebook, LinkedIn)
- ✅ Twitter Card tags
- ⏳ Favicon references (need images)
- ⏳ OG image references (need image)
